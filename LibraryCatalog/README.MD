**Library Catalog**
====================


### **About Project**
This application is a companion app developed as a part of my Embedded Systems course. This app fetches data from a mysql server hosted on my Raspberry Pi through a PHP script.
This data is JSON encoded. The app decodes the JSON and shows the data in my databse in a list.

Special thanks to [this tutorial](https://www.simplifiedcoding.net/android-volley-tutorial-to-get-json-from-server/) here that helped me out with the basics of fetching data from a server.
